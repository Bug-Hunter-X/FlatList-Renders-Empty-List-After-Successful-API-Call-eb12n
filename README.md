# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The `ActivityIndicator` disappears, suggesting the fetch is complete, but no items are displayed in the FlatList.

The bug is present in `DataFetch.js`. The solution is provided in `DataFetchSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data from a public API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`). Although the fetch is successful and the data is available in the component's state, the FlatList remains empty.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `data` array used by the `FlatList` contains the expected data structure. This often involves checking the data structure after the API call is successful.  The solution also incorporates error handling and more robust state management to prevent unexpected behaviour.
